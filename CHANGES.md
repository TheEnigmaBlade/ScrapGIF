# Version 0.5

## Additions

- Images can be removed from a library
- Clicking on the upload/copy notifications visits the URL
- Search components are disabled when no library exists
- Support for system drag modifier keys (ex. In Windows, hold ctrl to copy rather than move)
- Option to monitor library folders for new images (enabled by default)
- Option to use system window decoration

## Fixes

- Image menu information is updated immediately rather than when reopened (tags, upload)
